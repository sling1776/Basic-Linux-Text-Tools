# Printing portions of a file (`head` and `tail`)

## head

The `head` tool prints the first lines of files.  When the file is less than or equal to 10 lines long `head` is the same as `cat`

    $ python src/tt.py head data/let3
    a
    b
    c


    $ python src/tt.py head data/names10
    Jerry
    Bailey
    Frank
    Kai
    Angela
    Mikayla
    Hazel
    Karen
    Alexa
    Isabel


    $ python src/tt.py head data/words200 
    social
    insomniac
    implicitly
    cranky
    opponents
    clubroom
    uttering
    roughen
    easter
    dad



A different limit than 10 may be provided with the `-n` argument.  You'll need to convert this argument into a number yourself.

    $ python src/tt.py head -n 13 data/words200
    social
    insomniac
    implicitly
    cranky
    opponents
    clubroom
    uttering
    roughen
    easter
    dad
    sleighs
    honoraries
    smelt


    $ python src/tt.py head -n 1 data/words200
    social


When multiple files are given on the command line, identify each by preceeding their content with a banner:

    $ python src/tt.py head -n 3 data/ages8 data/names8 data/words200
    ==> data/ages8 <==
    Age
    22
    36

    ==> data/names8 <==
    Name
    Adrianna
    Julian

    ==> data/words200 <==
    social
    insomniac
    implicitly




## tail

`tail`, by contrast, prints the final 10 (or N) lines of a file.    When the file is less than or equal to 10 lines long `tail` is the same as `cat`

    $ python src/tt.py tail data/let3
    a
    b
    c



On longer files much of the content is suppressed in this way

    $ python src/tt.py tail data/words200
    convicting
    exacerbating
    indictment
    very
    impersonated
    latching
    reconfigurations
    activates
    autobiographies
    adverbs


As with `head`, a different number of lines is specified with the `-n` flag:

    $ python src/tt.py tail -n 4 data/words200
    reconfigurations
    activates
    autobiographies
    adverbs


    $ python src/tt.py tail -n 1 data/words200
    adverbs



Combining these tools enables one to extract a portion from the middle of a large file.  These commands use the shell's redirection operator `>` to extract words 80 - 97 from a list containing 200 words:

    $ python src/tt.py head -n 97 data/words200 > first97
    $ python src/tt.py tail -n 17 first97
    chrysanthemum
    malts
    draughts
    sterilizes
    hydrogen
    even
    pulsate
    upland
    outperforms
    subprogram
    lustiness
    handicap
    boom
    inhabiting
    improviser
    musicals
    the

## Handling errors

The program aborts as soon as a non-existent, invalid or inaccessible file is encountered.  You do not need to pre-screen the arguments before you begin processing; just let `open()` raise an exception.

Your program must detect and report the case where too few arguments are given; at a minimum the name of one input file is required:

    $ python src/tt.py tail
    Error: Too few arguments

    tt.py head|tail [-n N] FILENAME...
            Output the first or last part of files
            -n  Number of lines to print (default is 10)


The `-n` option to these tools itself requires an argument in the form of an integer.  Alert the user when this number is left off:

    $ python src/tt.py head -n
    Error: Number of lines is required

    tt.py head|tail [-n N] FILENAME...
            Output the first or last part of files
            -n  Number of lines to print (default is 10)


Alert the user when this argument is *not* in the form of an integer.  Your program doesn't know that "seven" means the same thing as "7", and errors out:

    $ python src/tt.py head -n seven
    Error: Number of lines is required

    tt.py head|tail [-n N] FILENAME...
            Output the first or last part of files
            -n  Number of lines to print (default is 10)
