# CS 1440 Assignment 1 Hints

## Look for Analogies

*   Each text tool shares the same structure: `Input -> Process -> Output`
*   Once you've written the first tool the rest are a variation on this theme
*   I suggest that you implement the tools in this order, beginning with `cat`: ![The Assignment #1 Tech Tree](Assn1_Tech_Tree.png)
*   Remember that these Python tools mimic existing Unix tools that you already have in your shell; when you are really stuck, just run the "real" tool to see what *it* would do


## Start with implementing the default behaviors

*   Don't worry about supporting optional command-line arguments until you have a tool's default behavior working right


## Segregate responsibilities

*   I've started you off with modules that keep related code together; embrace this organization and don't fight it
*   Decide which actions should happen in the driver program and which actions should occur in the module code
    *   Handle errors as soon as you can reasonably detect them, but do not go out of your way to detect them earlier than necessary; find a balance
    *   Don't open files too early in your program
    *   Don't wait too long to inspect the argument list


## Did you study the [examples](examples)?

*   Before you ask for clarification about what your program should do, look for an answer in the examples


## Python's list collection is your friend

*   Remember that files can be treated as lists of strings
*   Many of these text tools use a list or two at their heart
*   You job is made easier when you use methods of the `str` class which convert strings to/from lists
*   Python's lists can contain *anything*, even open files.
    *   Instead of reading many files into many lists, try putting the opened file objects into a single list.


## Close files when you are done with them

*   For every call to `open()` you should have a corresponding call to `close()`
*   When you let `open()` throw an error which causes your program to exit ,
    Python will call `close()` for you


## The contents of `sys.argv` are always strings

*   When your program must interpret an argument from `sys.argv` as a number, remember that you must convert it to a number yourself
*   Use `int()` instead of `eval()` to convert strings into numbers
    *   While `eval()` is very convenient it suffers from the major drawback of executing *anything* the user enters as a Python statement; this is a dangerous ability to entrust to your user


## Use `sys.exit()` to terminate your program immediately

*   When your program detects a serious error and cannot proceed, call `sys.exit()` with a non-zero integer parameter to indicate that your program has terminated unsuccessfully
*   Where required, do this in conjunction with calling `usage()` to report the problem to the user

    ```
    usage(error="Unrecognized argument", tool="grep")
    sys.exit(2)
    ```


## The `>` symbol is a feature of the Bash shell

Your program is only responsible for printing text to the console with `print()`.  The `>` redirection operator is part of the Bash shell.  You don't have to do anything in Python to enable it.


## Efficiency matters, but only if your code works at all

*   Focus on getting your code to work before worrying about speed
    *   Remember that you're graded on functionality, not performance
*   Each tool should deal with files one at a time
*   Process input files from beginning to end, one line at a time
        *   Work line-by-line instead of slurping an entire file into a single string variable
        *   For the `tac` tool don't seek to the end and read the file backwards; find another way to print a file in 
*   Some tools should process files line-by-line, accumulating nothing into memory.  
    *   Some tools, however, must accumulate lines of text into a list to process later
    *   One tool works best when open file objects are stored in a list that you loop over
    *   Identify which approach to take for each tool in your design phase
*   Python's `in` operator is your friend
*   Python's `str` class has some handy methods such as `str.split()` and `str.join()`
*   Lists can be `.sort()`ed and `.reverse()`ed
*   Strings that look like numbers are converted into integers with the `int()` function
    *   `eval()` is evil.
    *   **Do not use `eval()` to convert strings into numbers**
